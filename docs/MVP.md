# eraseALZ MVP1 – Scope and Checklist

This document defines the scope and success criteria for MVP1 of eraseALZ – a research assistant system designed to accelerate alzheimers (ALZ-1/2) cure discovery using AI.

---

##  MVP1 Goal
Deliver a working proof-of-concept that demonstrates eraseALZ’s ability to:
- Ingest biomedical content from multiple sources
- Detect relevant viral targets like ICP0, LAT, and UL39
- Simulate treatment strategies using docking/ADMET tools
- Output a structured, researcher-ready scientific report

---

##  MVP1 Scope

###  In Scope:
- Ingestion pipelines for 3 sources:
  - PubMed (abstracts)
  - Europe PMC (full-text when available)
  - PDFs from local/test source
- Extraction of biological targets using tagging agents
- One working simulation (e.g., docking + ADMET)
- Structured output in the form of a discovery report (Markdown or JSON)
- Local data lake folder structure with raw and processed content
- MVP1 checklist and architecture decisions documented

###  Out of Scope:
- Continuous polling / orchestration
- Full UI/dashboard
- Multi-agent coordination or scoring logic
- Multi-tenant or RBAC features
- OpenMetadata, GROBID, or Airbyte integration
