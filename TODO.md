## Roadmap

The eraseALZ roadmap outlines major development milestones, agent expansion plans, and areas open for collaboration.

###  Visionary Milestones

-  Establish eraseALZ as an open, modular platform for AI-driven drug discovery
-  Demonstrate multi-agent collaboration for molecular target identification and treatment design
-  Enable transparent, reproducible scientific discovery via open-source LLM pipelines
-  Bridge AI-generated insights with wet-lab testing through standardized report outputs
-  Foster global collaboration between AI engineers, researchers, and molecular biologists
-  Publish and maintain an open whitepaper and research framework on ALZ cure discovery
-  Set the foundation for expanding eraseALZ into broader discovery beyond Alzheimers

###  Upcoming Features, Stories, and Tasks

####  Feature: Agent Expansion
- [ ] Story: Build TargetPrioritizationAgent to prioritize molecular targets based on virology output
- [ ] Story: Develop DrugDesignAgent to generate SMILES-based drug candidates using LLM
- [ ] Story: Implement CRISPRDesignAgent to propose CRISPR guide sequences targeting ALZ genes

####  Feature: Scientific Report Engine
- [ ] Story: Add logic for generating structured scientific reports from agent outputs
- [ ] Task: Create sample report templates in Markdown and PDF format

####  Feature: Multi-Model Abstraction Layer
- [ ] Story: Extend ModelRouter to support local LLM providers (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA)
- [ ] Task: Add fallback mechanism between providers in ModelRouter

####  Feature: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Story: Add unit tests for all agents and core utilities
- [ ] Task: Add integration tests for multi-agent execution pipeline

####  Feature: Optional Frontend Interface
